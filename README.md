# SlicedWassersteinAE

This repository contains the implementation of our paper: "Sliced-Wasserstein Autoencoder: An Embarrassingly Simple Generative Model". The proposed method ameliorates the need for training adversarial networks in training generative models, and it provides a stable optimization while having a very simple implementation.
